# Lyapunov_Schmidt_Reduction

## Thesis 2022 

Politecnico di Milano

Authors: Marzorati Ars√®ne

Professor: Stefano Turzi

Goal: The Github project is divided into two parts:
+ The first is all the Mathematica code for deriving the equations and performing the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction
+ The second is the matlab code for finding numerically the results of the LS reduction.

## First step: Installation 
   For using the files, the user only needs to have Mathematica and matlab.
    
### Folder and its files

1) Folder  Bifurcation_Mathematica:
    * Equations_Change_Parameters: allows to derive the equations and solve the linearized problem for the original problem and the considered changes.
    * Lyapunov_Schmidt_Reduction: allows to perform the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction for the original problem and to derive the bifurcation equation.
        

2) Folder Matlab_Bifurcation
    * Find_Modes: Using the bvp5 function of matlab we force the different solutions of the LS reduction for different values of activity.
